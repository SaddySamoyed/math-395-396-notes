\bold{Problem A:} Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. Recall that a set $U$ is said to be open if for all $x\in U$ there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that $B_\epsilon(x) \subset U$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that the open sets according to this definition define a topology on $X$. 
\item Show that a sequence $(x_n)$ in $X$ converges to $x_\infty$ in  this topology if and only if for all $\epsilon>0$ there exists an $N>0$ such that if $n\geq N$ then 
$$d(x_n, x_\infty)<\epsilon.$$
\item Show that  for all $x\in X$ and all $r>0$, the ``open ball"
$$B_r(x) = \{ y \in X : d(x,y)<r\}$$
is in fact an open set by the definition above. 
\item Show that  for all $x\in X$ and all $r>0$, the ``closed ball"
$$ \{ y \in X : d(x,y)\leq r\}$$
is in fact a closed set by the definition above. 
\item Give an example of a metric space $(X,d)$, a point $x$, and an $r>0$ such that 
$$\{ y \in X : d(x,y)\leq r\}$$
is not the closure of $B_r(x)$. 
\end{enumerate}

\bold{Problem B:} Recall that a metric space is called complete if every Cauchy sequence converges. 

The Baire Category Theorem states the following: 

\begin{thm}
Let $(X,d)$ be a complete metric space, and let $(U_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ be a sequence of open dense sets in $X$. Then 
$$\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty U_n$$
is dense in $X$. 
\end{thm}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that this is false without the assumption of completeness by considering the rationals with the usual metric. 
\item Prove the Baire Category Theorem as follows. 
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Show that it suffices to show that for all $x_0\in X$ and $r_0>0$ the intersection contains a point of the ball $B_{r_0}(x_0)$. 
\item With $r_i, x_i$ already having been defined, show that you can pick $x_{i+1} \in X, 0< r_{i+1}< r_i/2$ so that 
$$\overline{B_{r_{i+1}} (x_{i+1})} \subset B_{r_i}(x_i) \cap U_{i+1}.$$
\item Show that the sequence $(x_i)$ is a Cauchy sequence. 
\item Show that the limit of $(x_i)$ is a point of $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty U_n$ contained in $B_{r_0}(x_0)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\bold{Problem C:} Suppose that $(X,d)$ is a (non-empty) complete metric space in which every point is a limit point. Use the Baire Category Theorem to show $X$ is uncountable.

\bold{Problem A:} Let us start with the interval $C=[0,1]$ and remove the middle third open interval $(\frac 13, \frac23)$. This leaves us with the set 
$$C_1=\left[0, \frac13\right]\cup \left[\frac23, 1\right]$$ formed of $2$ closed subintervals. Having constructed $$C_1\supset C_2\supset \cdots \supset C_n$$ where $C_n$ is the union of $2^n$ subintervals each of length $\frac{1}{3^n}$, we construct $C_{n+1}$ as follows: To obtain $C_{n+1}$ we remove the middle third of each of the $2^n$ intervals that form $C_n$. This leaves us with a union of $2^{n+1}$ intervals each of length $\frac{1}{3^{n+1}}$. Let $$C=\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} C_n.$$ This is called the (middle thirds) Cantor set. 

\begin{enumerate}

\item Show that $C$ is non-empty and compact.

\item Show that every point in $C$ is a limit point.  

\item Conclude using the last worksheet that $C$ is uncountable.

\item  Show that $C$ cannot contain any interval $(a, b)$. 

\item What is the total length of $C_n$? What would be a reasonable definition of the length of $C$?

\end{enumerate}


\bold{Problem B:} Motivated by the above, it would be grand to have a measure function that tells us how big or small a subset of $\R^d$ is. This would be a function from the set $\mathcal P(\R^d)$ of subsets of $\R^d$ into $[0, \infty]$, say $$m: \mathcal P(\R^d)\to [0,\infty].$$ We would like this function to satisfy the following properties: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item[a)] If $E_1, E_2, \ldots$ is a countable collection of disjoint subsets of $\R$, then 
$$
m(\cup_{n=1}^\infty E_n)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty m(E_n).
$$
\item[b)] If $E$ is congruent to $F$ (i.e. $F$ can be obtained from $E$ by applying rigid motions: translations, rotations, or reflections) then we should have that $m(E)=m(F)$.
\item[c)] $m([0,1)^d)=1$.
\end{enumerate} 

The bad news is that no such function can exist, and here's why (at least when $d=1$). Let us define an equivalence relation between elements of $[0,1)$ as follows: We say $x\sim y$ if $x-y$ is a rational number. Let $N$ be a subset of $[0,1)$ that contains exactly one element of each equivalence class (the existence of such a $N$ requires invoking the axiom of choice). Now let $$R=[0,1)\cap \Q,$$ and for each $r\in R$ define the set 
$$
N_r=\{x+r: x\in N\cap [0,1-r)\}\cup \{x+r-1: x\in N\cap [1-r, 1)\}.
$$
(Basically $N_r$ is just the translate of $N$ by $r$ units to the right, except that we move the part that sticks out of the interval $[0,1)$ one unit to the left).
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $[0,1)$ is the disjoint union of $N_r$ for $r\in R$.
\item Show that if a measure function satisfying a), b) and c) above exists, then $m(N)=m(N_r)$ for every $r\in R$.
\item Arrive at a contradiction.
\end{enumerate}

\bold{Remark:} One might think that possibly relaxing condition a) to cover only \emph{finitely} many disjoint sets $E_n$, i.e. 
        $$
m(\cup_{n=1}^N E_n)=\sum_{n=1}^N m(E_n).
$$    
would resolve the contradiction. Unfortunately, the Banach-Tarski paradox tells us that this is not enough to resolve this issue. 

Banach-Tarski tells us that we can split the unit ball in $\R^3$ into finitely many (actually 5 is sufficient) many disjoint pieces, apply rigid motions to those pieces and then reassemble them to obtain two copies of the unit ball.

\bold{Conclusion:} The problem with the above wishlist is that we insisted on being able to measure \emph{every} subset of $\R^d$. We have shown that this is impossible. The solution is to be content with a measure function that is defined on some but not all subsets. Such subsets will be called measurable subsets.

\bold{Definitions:} An interval $I$ is a subset of $\R$ of the form $[a,b], [a,b), (a, b]$, or $(a,b)$ where $a, b \in \R$. The length of $I$ is defined to be $|I|:=b-a$. 

A \emph{box} in $\R^d$ is a Cartesian product of intervals $$B=I_1 \times \cdots \times I_d$$ and its \emph{volume} is defined to be $$|B|=|I_1|\times \cdots \times |I_d|.$$ 

An \emph{elementary set} is any subset of $\R^d$ which is the union of a finite number of boxes. 

\bold{Problem A:} Show that if $E, F\subset \R^d$ are elementary sets, then the union $E\cup F$, the intersection $E\cap F$, the set theoretic difference $E\setminus F$, and the symmetric difference $E\Delta F=(E\setminus F)\cup (F\setminus E)$ are also elementary. Also, if $x\in \R^d$, then the translate $E+x:=\{y+x: y \in E\}$ is also elementary. 

\bold{Problem B:} Show that any elementary set $E$ can be expressed as the finite union of disjoint boxes. (Hint: Start with $d=1$.)

\bold{Definition:} Let $E$ be an elementary set. The above question allows to write $$E=B_1 \cup B_2 \cup \cdots \cup B_n,$$ where $B_1, \ldots, B_n$ are disjoint. We define the elementary measure of $E$ as $$m(E):=|B_1|+|B_2|+\cdots+|B_n|.$$

\bold{Problem C:} Show that $m(E)$ is well-defined in the sense that if $E$ can be expressed in two ways as a union of disjoint boxes $B_1, \ldots, B_n$ and $B_1', \ldots, B_m'$, then 
 
 $$|B_1|+|B_2|+\cdots+|B_n|=|B_1'|+|B_2'|+\cdots+|B_m'|.$$

There's more than one approach you can take, but here you should use the following approach: First prove that for an interval $I$ in $\R$,  
$$
|I|=\lim_{N\to \infty} \frac{1}{N}\# \left(I\cap \frac{1}{N} \Z\right),
$$
where $\#S$ denotes the number of elements of a set $S$. 
And more generally for a box $B$, prove that
$$
|B|=\lim_{N\to \infty} \frac{1}{N^d}\# \left(B\cap \frac{1}{N} \Z^d\right).
$$
Here $\frac{1}{N} \Z^d=\{\frac{k}{N}: k \in \Z^d\}$. Use this to give an alternative definition of $m(E)$ for an elementary set that does not rely on its decomposition into disjoint boxes.

\bold{Problem D:} Show that the following holds
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $E_1, \ldots, E_n$ are disjoint elementary sets, then 
$$
m(E_1 \cup \cdots \cup E_n)=\sum_{i=1}^n m(E_i)
$$
Recall that this is called finite additivity.

\item If $E\subset F$ are two elementary sets, then 
$$
m(E) \leq m(F).
$$ 
This property is called monotonicity.

\item Show that if $E_1, E_2, \ldots, E_n$ is an arbitrary finite collection of elementary sets, then 
$$
m(E_1\cup \cdots \cup E_n)\leq m(E_1) +\cdots+ m(E_n).
$$
This is called finite subadditivity.
 \end{enumerate}
 
\bold{Why is this unsatisfactory?} Of course, the main problem with this measure is that we can only measure relatively simple sets (namely the elementary sets). For example, we cannot measure the area of a disc. 

\bold{Definition:} One might be tempted to generalize this measure naively as follows: For an arbitrary set $E \subset \R^d$, define 
 $$
 m_{\mathrm{pixel}}(E)=\lim_{N\to \infty} \frac{1}{N^d}\# \left(E\cap \frac{1}{N} \Z^d\right).
 $$
 
This is not a particurlary satisfactory definition either. One reason (out of many) is the following: 
 
 \bold{Problem E:}
Find a subset $E$ of $\R$ such that both $m_{\mathrm{pixel}}(E)$ and $m_{\mathrm{pixel}}(E+x)$ exist, but $m_{\mathrm{pixel}}(E)\neq m_{\mathrm{pixel}}(E+x)$ for some $x\in \R$.

The main caveat of elementary measure is that it only allows us to measure elementary sets, which is a fairly restrictive family of sets. Building on the old intuition (going back at least to Archimedes) we can lower bound (respectively upper bound) the measure of a set by approximating it from within (respectively without) by an elementary set, i.e. if $A$ and $B$ are elementary and $A\subset E \subset B$, then the measure of $E$ (if it exists) should be sandwiched between that of $A$ and $B$. 

\bold{Definitions:} Let $E \subset \R^d$ be a bounded set. 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item The \emph{Jordan inner measure} $\underline m_J(E)$ of $E$ is defined as 
 $$
 \underline m_J(E)=\sup_{A\subset E, A\,  \textrm{elementary}} m(A).
 $$
 Here $m(A)$ is the elementary measure of $A$.
 
 \item The \emph{Jordan outer measure} $\overline m_J(E)$ of $E$ is defined as 
 $$
 \overline m_J(E)=\inf_{A\supset E, A\,  \textrm{elementary}} m(A).
 $$
\item If $\underline m_J(E)=\overline m_J(E)$, we say that $E$ is Jordan measurable, and call the common value $m(E)$ (the Jordan measure of $E$).

By convention, we do not consider unbounded sets to be Jordan measurable.  
\end{itemize}


\bold{Problem A:} Assume that $E \subset \R^d$ is bounded. Show that the following are equivalent:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item[a)] $E$ is Jordan measurable. 
 \item[b)] For every $\epsilon>0$, there exists elementary sets $A$ and $B$ such that $A\subset E \subset B$ and $m(B\setminus A)\leq \epsilon$.
 \item[c)] For every $\epsilon>0$, there exists an elementary set $A$ such that $\overline m_J(E\Delta A)\leq \epsilon$.
 \end{enumerate}

\bold{Problem B:} Deduce that every elementary set $E$ is Jordan measurable and that its Jordan measure is the same as its elementary measure. In particular, $m(\emptyset)=0$.


\bold{Problem C:} Let $E, F$ be Jordan measurable sets.  Clearly $m(E) \geq 0$. Show that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item  $E\cup F, E\cap F, E\setminus F, $ and $E\Delta F$ are all Jordan measurable. 
\item (Finite additivity) If $E$ and $F$ are disjoint, then $m(E\cup F)=m(E)+m(F)$.
\item (Monotonicity) If $E \subset F$, then $m(E)\leq m(F)$. 
\item (Finite subadditivity) $m(E\cup F) \leq m(E)+m(F)$. 
\item (Translation invariance) for any $x\in \R^d$, $m(E+x)=m(E)$.
 \end{enumerate}

 
 
\bold{Problem D:} Let $B$ be a closed box of $\R^d$ and $f: B\to \R$ a continuous function. 

 \begin{enumerate}
 \item Show that the graph $\{(x, f(x)): x\in B\}\subset \R^{d+1}$ is Jordan measurable in $\R^{d+1}$ and that it has Jordan measure 0. \emph{Hint: Use that $f$ is uniformly continuous.}
 \item Show that the set $\{(x, t):x\in B, 0\leq t \leq f(x)\}\subset \R^{d+1}$ is Jordan measurable. 
\end{enumerate} 

From this we conclude that some familiar sets like triangles in $\R^2$ and balls in $\R^d$ are Jordan measurable. 

\bold{Problem E:} Is $\bQ \cap [0,1]$ Jordan measurable? What are its inner and outer Jordan measure?

\bold{Problem A:} Show that the open and closed balls of radius $r$ in $\bR^d$ are both Jordan measurable, and that their Jordan measure is $c_d r^d$ for some constant $c_d>0$ that only depends on the dimension.
 
%\emph{Hint: A half ball can be written as the region below a graph} %Another Show that the ball is the finite union of (possibly not disjoint) subsets of the form described in {\bf Q2)} above. You can use without proof that if $E$ is Jordan measurable and $L$ is a rotation then $L(E)$ is also Jordan measurable.}  

\bold{Problem B (optional):} Establish the bound $\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt d}\right)^d \leq c_d\leq 2^d$. 

\bold{Problem C:} Let $E \subset \R^d$ be bounded. Show that both $E$ and its closure $\overline E$ have the same Jordan outer measure. 

\bold{Problem D:} Let $E \subset \R^d$ be bounded.  Show that $E$ and its interior have the same Jordan inner measure. 

\bold{Problem E:} Show that $E$ is Jordan measurable if and only if the topological boundary $\partial E=\overline E\setminus E^\circ$ has Jordan outer measure 0. Here $E^\circ$ denotes the interior of $E$. 

\bold{Recall:} To define the Riemann integral of a {bounded} function $f$ on an interval $[a,b]\subset \R$, we first recall the notion of a partition $\mathcal P$, which is a set of points $$x_0=a<x_1<x_2<\cdots <x_n=b.$$ The norm of the partition is $\Delta \mathcal P=\max_{1\leq k \leq n} x_k-x_{k-1}$, and we denote by $\Delta x_k=x_k-x_{k-1}$. For each such partition, we define to quantities:
 $$
 L(f, \mathcal P)=\sum_{k=1}^n  \Delta x_k \inf_{[x_{k-1}, x_k]} f, \quad \text{and} \quad U(f, \mathcal P)=\sum_{k=1}^n \Delta x_k \sup_{[x_{k-1}, x_k]} f.
 $$
We define the lower and upper Darboux integrals respectively as
 $$
 \underline{\int_a^b} f(x) dx=\sup_{\mathcal P} L(f, \mathcal P), \quad and \quad \overline{\int_a^b} f(x) dx=\inf_{\mathcal P} U(f, \mathcal P).
 $$
 where the extrema above are taken over all partitions of the interval $[a,b]$. We say that $f$ is Riemann integrable if the above two numbers are equal. We define the common value as the Riemann (or Darboux) integral of $f$.
 
\bold{Problem F:} Let $[a,b]$ be an interval and let $f:[a,b]\to \R$ be a bounded nonnegative function. Show that $f$ is Riemann integrable if and only if the set $E:=\{(x,t): x\in [a,b]: 0\leq t \leq f(x)\}$ is Jordan measurable in $\R^2$.

\bold{Where we are right now?} We have thus far discussed the classical theory of Jordan measure, which went as follows:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item We define the notion of a box and its volume $|B|$ or $v(B)$,
 \item Then we defined the notion of an elementary set and its elementary measure,
 \item Then we defined the notion of Jordan inner and outer measure $\underline m_J(E)$ and $\overline m^J(E)$ and said that a set $E$ is Jordan measurable if those two concepts agree. 
 \end{enumerate}

 In particular, unwinding the definition of the Jordan outer measure, we have that for any set $E$
 $$
 \overline{m}_J(E)= \inf_{E\subset B_1 \cup \cdots \cup B_k} |B_1|+\cdots+|B_k|
 $$
 where the infimum is taken over all finite coverings of $E$ by boxes $B_1, \ldots, B_k$.
 
\bold{Problem A:} Show that a set $E$ is Jordan measurable if and only if for every $\epsilon>0$ there exists an elementary set $U$ containing $E$ such that $\overline{m}_J(U\setminus E)<\epsilon$.


 
\bold{Lebesgue outer measure.} 
The notions of Lebesgue outer measure and Lebesgue measurability are refinements of the Jordan ones as follows:

 We modify the notion of Jordan outer measure by replacing the finite union of boxes by a countable union of boxes, i.e.
$$
m^*(E)=\inf_{E\subset \cup_{j=1}^\infty B_j} \sum_{j=1}^\infty |B_j|
$$
where the union above is taken over boxes $B_j \subset \R^d$. This is the Lebesgue outer measure of $E$. 


\bold{Problem B:}  Show that $m^*(E)\leq \overline{m}_J(E)$ where $\bar m_J$ is the Jordan outer measure. 

\bold{Problem C:} Show that in the definition above the countable cover by boxes in the definition of $m^*(E)$ can be restricted to closed boxes or open boxes.


\bold{Problem D:} Show that the Lebesgue outer measure $m^*(E)$ is zero for any countable set $E$. Contrast this to fact that the Jordan outer measure of the rationals in $[0,1]$ was equal to 1.




\bold{Lebesgue measurability.} A set $E\subset \R^d$ is said to be Lebesgue measurable if for every $\epsilon>0$, there exists an open set $U\subset \R^d$ containing $E$ such that $m^*(U\setminus E)\leq \epsilon$. If $E$ is measurable, we refer to $m(E)=m^*(E)$ as the Lebesgue measure of $E$. 



\bold{Remarks:}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Note that there is no need for $E$ to be bounded for this definition to make sense. 
\item The notion of Lebesgue measurability can be seen as a (finite to countably infinite) generalization of that of Jordan measurability since it can be shown that every open set is the countable union of closed boxes.  
\end{enumerate}

\bold{Problem E:} Show that $m^*(\emptyset)=0$.

\bold{Problem F:} (Monotonicity) Show that if $E\subset F\subset \R^d$, then $m^*(E) \leq m^*(F)$.


\bold{Problem G:} (Countable subadditivity) If $E_1, E_2, \ldots \subset \R^d$ is a countable sequence of sets, then $m^*\left(\cup_{n=1}^\infty E_n\right)\leq \sum_{n=1}^\infty m^*(E_n)$.

\bold{Recall:}  The Lebesgue outer measure of $E\subset \R^d$ is 
$$m^*(E)=\inf_{E\subset \cup_{j=1}^\infty B_j} \sum_{j=1}^\infty |B_j|
$$
where the union above is taken over boxes $B_j \subset \R^d$. 

 A set $E\subset \R^d$ is said to be Lebesgue measurable if for every $\epsilon>0$, there exists an open set $U\subset \R^d$ containing $E$ such that $m^*(U\setminus E)\leq \epsilon$. If $E$ is measurable, we refer to $m(E)=m^*(E)$ as the Lebesgue measure of $E$. 

Last time you proved monotonicity and countable sub-additivity.  
 
\bold{Problem A:} Show that if $\mathrm{dist}(E,F)>0$, then $$m^*(E\cup F)=m^*(E)+m^*(F).$$
 


\bold{Problem B:}  Show that if $E$ is an elementary set, then $m^*(E)=m(E)$ where $m(E)$ is the elementary measure of $E$ defined before.



\bold{Problem C:} Conclude that if $E$ is any bounded set, then $$\underline m(E) \leq m^*(E) \leq \overline m (E)$$ where $\underline m(E)$ and $\overline m(E)$ are the inner and outer Jordan measures of $E$. 



\bold{Problem D:} Construct a bounded open subset $U$ of $\R$ that is not Jordan measurable. \emph{Hint: Start with an enumeration of the rationals in $[0,1]$ and create an open set whose Lebesgue outer-measure is arbitrarily small but the Jordan outer measure is $\geq 1$.}




\bold{Problem E:} We say that two boxes are \emph{almost disjoint} if their interiors are disjoint. Let $E=\cup_{n=1}^\infty B_n$ be a countable union of almost disjoint boxes $B_k$. Show that 
$$
m^*(E)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty |B_k|.
$$
\begin{proof}
By the monotinicity of Legesgue outer measure, it suffices to prove: the Lebesgue outer measure of unions of $B_k$ is greater than or equal to the sum of volumes of $B_k$. And, since volume does not consider openness/closeness, it suffices to prove that the Lebesgue outer measure of unions of $B_k$ is greater than or equal to the sum of volumes of interiors of $B_k$
\end{proof}
